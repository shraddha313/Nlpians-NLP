-------------------------Assignment -1 ------------------------

1.First we have to prepare dataset take 3000 doc for train and 1000 doc for test from computer sciecne domain 


2.we have to clean data..(i) stopwords, (ii) urls, (iii) bullets, (iv) apostrophe, (v) hyphens, (vi) enumerations (eg. like how this list is being enumerated), (vii), numerical-to-text conversion, (viii) punctuations.


3. take count of valid word and essentially "Invalid " and "invalid" are same we have to make our daatbase case insensetive


4. after doing this preare input and output and tf-idf matrix 
where input matrix will contain 1 in prence of target sentence's words 
where output matrix will contain 1 in presence of contex sentecne 's words 
tf-idf matrix take each sentence as a document find idf for count take acciunt of whole contex window words 



5. we wil forward pass using activation function softmax 
and use loss as negative log likelihood 
and alos update contex  and target matrix embeding  


6.for evaluating use cosine simaliarity
